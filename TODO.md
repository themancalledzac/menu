# TODO's in no general order

## Authentication

## Heroku connection

- This one is tough because I went with the sick-fits model of backend/frontend folders, which means there was no initial package.json file in the root folder.

- Which means, we need to verify that what I've started in that root package.json file will not only start up both, but properly create our next app/heroku build.

## Frontend styling

- I am looking at combining styled-components with Material-UI

  - Seems like they should work in tamdem with each other, where Material-UI gives us components to use, and styled-components lets us customize them to our will.

- White background, high contrast slightly off black secondary.
  - Color scheme is an interesting thought that we can come back to later
  - would be cool to have a 'dark mode' switch.
    - I say this as the future (of css, android, etc) seems to be sites with prefered colors, dark/light/highcontrast, etc... would be nice to have that as an option from the start.
      - would basically be a bit of state from the start that specifies what mode the site is in.
- Sick Fits style loading animation, and hover animations for buttons would be great.

### Page Layout

- Top Bar

  - Logo created.
  - Navigation buttons

    - Home

      - Landing page
      - Our about page basically, explains the app, explains login(?) features, such as admin and guest.
      - Could have two cards wide (1 wide for mobile) that explain in depth what each login sees, purpose, future development. Each of these two cards would have a 'switch login' button on the bottom to switch user.

        - This could honestly be an easy switch-user which updates state for every page.

      - Could have an intial Model that pops up on first visit, that asks if you want to view the page as an admin or as a guest(?) makes it a one click login basically, so we don't need to deal with actual passwords/usernames/resets/etc

        - this would be awesome with like 3 little bullets below each, that explain what special things you'll see for each type of login, i.e:

          - Customers can view order burger page
          - Admin can view order stock page

    - Create

      - Our main page that allows users to create their own, or customize previous burgers
      - Admin access might show stock data on each ingredient.
      - A header card with a little info on what to do, maybe a little blurb on the organic farms we source our materials from(? could be a cool page all it's own, 'local businesses we shop from')
      - A main card containing mapped ingredients. Each internal card for protein/topping/condiment would be in a similar grid fashion:

        - Left would be name of ingredient, right would be price of ingredient. On clicking each item, that ingredient's individual card would be highlighted, maybe an internal glow(?) of green.

        - top internal card is protein
          - you can order multiple of the same protein, but others are greyed out once you choose 1. Maybe there is a little "want to double?" button on the side once you choose your protein.
          - Each protein would show name and price next to id.

    - Favorites
      - prebuilt burgers
      - Admin access might show number of available, while guest login would show a greyed out image if not available.
      - Would be nice to have some sort of graphic of each
      - Would be nice to have a 'search by', and a 'order by' functionality on top.
      - Layout would be one main card, with internal cards for each burger.
      - Layout for internal cards would be image on the left, mapped ingredients on right.
    - Cart/Order
      - For customers maybe this is their cart to view and then pay
        - Go the sick-fits route, have a pop-out order on the right side with all items in the cart, pay(maybe have a fake card autofilled for display purposes)
        - Honestly the customer route should probably be it's own page.
          - I am invisioning most non-download order pages that restarants are using right now, and each of them seems like a whole page, not a pop-out for the pay screen.
      - For Admin this would be ordering stock of items. Maybe viewing all stock available, with a button to 'order' or add stock to each.
        - We could have this simply as an easy 'add x number to stock' next to each item in a list, for now...
        - Later functionality could be making it seem more legit. i.e:
          - Ordering items takes x number of days to get back into stock, or:
          - organizing by out of stock, or most ordered, or auto-order when getting low

- Mobile View
  - Top logo - title name on top, full width
  - Nav (if we stick with the 3 tabs) can stay full width, 33% each
    - Thoughts on scrolling down hides the top bar? But as soon as you scroll up again it pops up? That way we get more full screen coverage when looking at items
  - Main Body
    - 90% width, we really want to maximize coverage
  - Footer
    - designed by Us
    - Links to our respective portfolios

## Backend

- The seed files are just a super rough estimate from a month ago so take that with a grain of salt. BUT...
- We will have a DB containing each ingredient, in categories of:
  - Protein
    - Price, calories, availability, (?)
  - Topping
    - Price, calories, availability, (?)
  - Condiment(?) i mean, if we go all out on the others, might as well do this too
- We also have a DB containing built burgers with connections to each ingredient included.
  - Each burger would have:
    - connections to ingredients,
    - number of times ordered
    - stock availability? this would need to be updated each time a burger is ordered, or stock is updated.
- Customer creation are simple CREATE_PRODUCT graphQL strings with ingredient associations.
- Admin ingredient ordering would simply be an 'update product' style graphQL string to update stock.
- Customer ordering of items would be another 'update product' graphQL string to lower stock of each ingredient ordered.
- I guess we don't really need to worry about users on the backend?

## Graphics

- Logo needed
  - I can do some photoshop magic for some sort of graphic/logo.
- Burger images? Maybe we should try for 8bit style burgers with different toppings associated with each? So if you create a burger with lettuce and tomato, you get the burger with green and red lol
