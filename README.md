## Description

---

- My goal with this project is to build a functioning application for use by both customers and staff.

  - A one stop application for customers to look at the menu, and order premade, or custom items.
  - Purchasing through Stripe
  - Database is included for stock quantities, management, and availability.
  - Staff side of application will allow for multiple login access points, from help staff to management.

## How I am working on this project

---

- My goal for this is to build a functioning full stack application in a simulated professional working environment.

  - future images of designs: \_\_\_
  - Working with Trello task board: **_screenshot?_**
  - Will be using Travis CI for testing on deployment.

## Challenges

---

- Doing an entire application on my own can seem daunting, but breaking it into smaller bite size chunks has been the best path towards success. A few of the challenges I've been facing are:

  - Moving towards custom CSS instead of using a framework.
    - I really wanted to challenge myself on this project by removing all framework code, and forcing myself to problem solve each little bit. This has/will include Hover effects, loading animation, screen resizing, menu change based on width, page components looking modern, accordian style functionality for the creation page, and many many more.
    - With the release of MUI next, the new version of material-ui, I will be migrating over to save time. ha.
  - Looks like Keystone-next, or v6 of KeystoneJS is not currently compatible with MongoDB, and as such I will need to migrate over to and learn, Prisma - PostgreSQL. Since I've already used MySQL in the past this shouldn't be too difficult of a transition.
